# 🧠 Mental Health Dashboard Analysis Using Tableau

This repository provides a comprehensive mental health data analysis project built using **interactive dashboards** and **statistical exploration** of mental health indicators. It tracks trends in **anxiety**, **depression**, **mood**, and **stress levels** over a 13-month period to inform interventions and wellness strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Power BI  
- **Time Frame**: 13-month rolling period  
- **Key Metrics**: GAD (Anxiety), PHQ (Depression), Mood States, Stress Levels  
- **Visualizations**: Line charts, bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators

| Metric                    | Value   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **Average Anxiety (GAD)** | 5.90    |
| **Average Depression (PHQ)** | 7.32 |

These values serve as baseline indicators of the population's mental health over the reporting period.

---

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### 🔄 Trends Over Time (Line Chart)
- GAD and PHQ scores rise and fall in **parallel**, indicating strong **comorbidity**.
- Spikes identify **external triggers** like seasonal or environmental stressors.

---

### 📊 Anxiety & Depression Distributions
- **Most individuals fall into the “minimal” category** for both anxiety and depression.
- A long tail exists for moderate to severe categories, warranting closer monitoring.

---

### 📦 GAD vs PHQ Severity (Box Plot)
- **Anxiety scores increase** with **depression severity**.
- Supports joint screening and targeted care.

### 😊 Mood Breakdown
| Mood      | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Angry     | 60    |
| Neutral   | 58    |
| Depressed | 51    |
| Relaxed   | 50    |
| Happy     | 49    |
| Stressed  | 46    |

- Balanced mood distribution
- Slight dominance of **negative affect states**

---

### 💢 Stress Level Analysis
| Stress Level | Count |
|--------------|-------|
| Low          | 157   |
| Medium       | 157   |
| High         | 51    |

- Equal distribution of low and medium stress
- Fewer high-stress reports may indicate **under-reporting** or resilience

---

### 🔗 Correlation Patterns
- **Strong positive alignment** between anxiety and depression trends
- **Seasonal spikes** likely linked to external factors (e.g., holidays, work cycles)
- Mood and stress show **non-linear relationships**, suggesting deeper behavioral complexity

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### 🎯 Targeted Interventions
- Focus on **mild-to-moderate cases** to prevent escalation
- Launch **resilience workshops** during historical peak months

### 🌈 Mood Enhancement
- Promote activities that shift mood from **angry/depressed** to **happy/relaxed**
- Use follow-up surveys to measure intervention impact

### 🧘 Stress Management
- Offer **guided mindfulness or breathing sessions**
- Address potential **under-reported high-stress risks**

### 🔍 Deeper Analysis
- Investigate patterns by **age, occupation, or season**
- Correlate with **external events** (e.g., exams, fiscal periods)
